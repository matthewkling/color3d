Package: colors3d
Title: Generate 2D and 3D Color Palettes
Version: 1.0.1
Authors@R: person("Matthew", "Kling", email = "mattkling@berkeley.edu", role = c("aut", "cre", "cph"))
Description: Generate multivariate color palettes to represent two-dimensional or three-dimensional data in graphics (in contrast to standard color palettes that represent just one variable). You tell 'colors3d' how to map color space onto your data, and it gives you a color for each data point. You can then use these colors to make plots in base 'R', 'ggplot2', or other graphics frameworks.
