## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version:

* I have written TRUE and FALSE instead of T and F.

* I confirm that there are NO references describing the methods in your package, so I have left that field of the DESCRIPTION file blank.


## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
